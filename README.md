# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analytics-Using-Power-BI
This project involves analyzing Amazon sales data using Power BI to create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard. The goal is to gain insights into sales trends, profit margins, regional performance, and category contributions. Using advanced DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas and Power BI's visual capabilities capabilities, this project translates raw data into actionable business intelligence.<br>

The dataset includes detailed sales records such as product categories, sales regions, quantities sold, total revenue, and profit margins. The dashboard provides stakeholders with a powerful tool to make data-driven decisions and optimize business strategies.<br>
<h3>Objectives</h3><br>
<h3>Sales Performance Analysis:</h3> Provide a detailed view of total sales, profit, and profit margins.<br>
<h3>Regional Insights:</h3>Identify top-performing regions and analyze their contributions to overall sales.<br>
<h3>Category Analysis:</h3> Determine the most profitable product categories.<br>
<h3>Trend Visualization:</h3> Analyze time-based trends in sales and profit to identify patterns.<br>
<h3>Interactive Exploration:</h3> Empower stakeholders to explore data through filters, slicers, and visual interactivity.<br>

<h3>Dataset Overview</h3><br>
The dataset, Amazon Sales data.csv, contains the following fields:<br>
<h4>Order ID:</h4> A unique identifier for each order.<br>
<h4>Product:</h4> Name of the product sold.<br>
<h3>Category:</h3> Category of the product (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).<br>
<h4>Region:</h4> Sales region (e.g., North America, Europe).<br>
<h4>Quantity:</h4> Number of units sold per order.<br>
<h4>Price:</h4> Unit price of the product.<br>
<h4>Total Sales:</h4> Total revenue for the order (calculated as Quantity Ã— Price).<br>
<h4>Profit:</h4> Profit earned on each order.<br>
<h3>Step 1: Data Preparation</h3><br>
<h4>Import Data into Power BI:</h4><br>
Use the "Get Data" feature to load the Amazon Sales data.csv file into Power BI.<br>
<h4>Clean Data with Power Query:</h4><br>
Check for Missing Values: Ensure all necessary fields such as Price, Profit, and Region are complete.<br>
Validate Data Types: Confirm that numerical fields like Quantity, Total Sales, and Profit are set to decimal or whole number types, and date fields are properly formatted.<br>

<h4>Create Derived Columns:</h4><br>
<h5>Year:</h5> Extracted from the order date to enable year-over-year comparisons.
<h5>Month:</h5> For analyzing seasonal trends.<br>
<h5>Order Contribution:</h5> Percent contribution of each order to the total sales.<br>
<h5>Load Data:</h5> Apply changes and load the cleaned data into the Power BI workspace.<br>
<h5>Step 2:</h5> Developing Key Metrics with DAX<br>

<h3>Using DAX, create measures to enable insightful analysis:</h3><br>
<h4>Total Sales:</h4><br>
Total Sales = SUM('Sales Data'[Total Sales])<br>
<h4>Total Profit:</h4><br>
Total Profit = SUM('Sales Data'[Profit])<br>
<h4>Profit Margin:</h4><br>
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)<br>
<h4>Top-Selling Region:</h4><br>
Top-Selling Region = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Sales], 
    TOPN(1, ALL('Sales Data'[Region]), [Total Sales], DESC)
)
<h4>Sales by Category:</h4><br>
Sales by Category = 
SUMMARIZE(
    'Sales Data',
    'Sales Data'[Category],
    "Total Sales", [Total Sales]
)<br>
Sales by Category = 
SUMMARIZE(
    'Sales Data',
    'Sales Data'[Category],
    "Total Sales", [Total Sales]
)<br>
